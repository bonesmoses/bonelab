# bonelab - Building a playground, one old tire at a time

Welcome to my home lab! It's basically a junkyard of stuff I've been working on in my literal basement. I've decided to create a repository to keep track of everything, and maybe someone else may find it useful.

## Bootstrapping

Anything related to getting the system up and running is explained in this section. This will generally include items related to Proxmox, the underlying filesystem, and other important notes.

[Go to Bootstrapping README](bootstrapping/README.md)

## Kubernetes

I've been playing with Kubernetes recently, and this deserves a whole section of its own. Important topics include VM deployment, cluster init, common tools, and so on.

## Ansible

Standardizing configuration management with Ansible is a very common pattern. This section will grow over time as I develop new automations.
