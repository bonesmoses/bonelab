# Creating a Playground Kubernetes Cluster

These instructions will explain how to set up a [K0s Kubernetes Cluster](https://k0sproject.io/) in on a Proxmox host. These steps will create a VM template which is then cloned numerous times and set as targets for subsequent steps. Once the initial cluster is online, we include a few more to make the cluster actually _usable_, as K0s deployments are incredibly bare-bones.
